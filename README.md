# EvoSim
### The beginnings of an evolutionary simulator

## Progress
So far, EvoSim is just a PyGame rendered environment with deadly spinning
sticks falling from the sky. Eventually, I hope to train bugs how to
avoid those sticks. The idea is not fully fleshed out, but my hope is
to learn a lot about basic neural networks, reinforcement learning, and
evolutionary algorithms.

## Code Style
Documenting the method behind the madness
### Debug Statements
These are controlled by `settings.debug` in `settings.py`. All debug 
statements should be responsive to this value.
