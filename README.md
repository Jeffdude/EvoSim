# EvoSim
The beginnings of an evolutionary simulator

## Progress
So far, EvoSim is just a PyGame rendered environment with deadly spinning
sticks falling from the sky. Eventually, I hope to train bugs how to
avoid those sticks. The idea is not fully fleshed out, but my hope is
to learn a lot about basic neural networks and neuroevolutionary algorithms.

### To Do
1. Bring the bugs to life
..1. Basic Neuralnet
..2. Fitness evaluation
..3. Evolving (vague)
